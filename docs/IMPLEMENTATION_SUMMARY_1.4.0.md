# Version 1.4.0 - Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Removed Audience Query Search
- Converted audience query field from Select2 searchable dropdown to simple text input
- Updated field definition in `class-omeda-deployment-types.php`
- Removed Select2 initialization for audience query field
- Added helpful placeholder: "My Audience Builder Query"
- Enhanced field description with clear instructions

**Rationale:** Since Omeda doesn't provide an API to list audience queries, a simple text field with clear instructions is more appropriate than a searchable dropdown.

### 2. ✅ Added Default Email Settings
- Added new settings section: "Default Email Settings"
- Three new global options:
  - `omeda_default_from_name` (defaults to site name)
  - `omeda_default_from_email` (defaults to admin email)  
  - `omeda_default_reply_to` (defaults to admin email)
- Settings accessible at **Omeda Integration** → **Settings**
- New `render_email_field()` method for email input validation

### 3. ✅ Auto-Populate Email Fields
- New deployment types automatically populate with default values
- Checks post status (`auto-draft`) to determine when to apply defaults
- Existing deployment types retain their saved values (no overwriting)
- Users can still override defaults for specific deployment types

### 4. ✅ Version Update
- Plugin version bumped from 1.3.0 to 1.4.0
- Updated in both plugin header and `OMEDA_WP_VERSION` constant
- This is a minor release (new features, no breaking changes)

### 5. ✅ Documentation
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with comprehensive 1.4.0 entry
- Created `RELEASE_NOTES_1.4.0.md` with detailed feature descriptions
- Created `TESTING_GUIDE_1.4.0.md` with complete test procedures

## Files Modified

1. **src/omeda-newsletter-connector/includes/class-omeda-settings.php**
   - Added email defaults section
   - Added three new setting fields
   - Added `render_email_field()` method
   - Added `email_defaults_section_callback()` method

2. **src/omeda-newsletter-connector/includes/class-omeda-deployment-types.php**
   - Updated `render_settings_meta_box()` to auto-populate email fields
   - Simplified `enqueue_admin_assets()` (removed audience query Select2)

   - Removed `render_audience_query_dropdown()` method

## New Features

### Default Email Settings Page
Location: **Omeda Integration** → **Settings** → "Default Email Settings" section

This new section allows administrators to set default values for:
- From Name (sender name)
- From Email (sender email address)
- Reply To Email (reply-to address)

These defaults are used when creating new deployment types, reducing repetitive data entry.

### Auto-Population Logic
When creating a new deployment type:
1. System checks if post is new (`auto-draft` status)
2. If new, checks for saved default values
3. Falls back to site name/admin email if no defaults
4. Pre-fills the From Name, From Email, and Reply To fields
5. User can still override these values

Existing deployment types are not affected and keep their original values.

## Testing

The plugin has been restarted in wp-env and is now running version 1.4.0.

**To test:**
```bash
# Environment is already running at:
# - Development: http://localhost:8888/wp-admin
# - Test: http://localhost:8889/wp-admin
# - Credentials: admin / password

# Follow the testing guide:
docs/TESTING_GUIDE_1.4.0.md
```

**Key Test Cases:**
1. Configure default email settings
2. Create new deployment type (verify auto-population)
3. Edit existing deployment type (verify values retained)
4. Verify audience query is simple text field
5. Confirm Select2 still works for deployment type and post type dropdowns

## Technical Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ No database migration required
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Existing deployment types unaffected
- ✅ All previous features still functional

### Database Schema
**New Options Added:**
- `omeda_default_from_name` (string)
- `omeda_default_from_email` (string, email format)
- `omeda_default_reply_to` (string, email format)

**Post Meta:** No changes to existing post meta structure

### JavaScript Changes
- Removed Select2 initialization for `#_omeda_audience_query_id`
- Kept Select2 for `#_omeda_deployment_type_id` and `#_omeda_assigned_post_type`

### PHP Changes
- New method: `Omeda_Settings::render_email_field()`
- New method: `Omeda_Settings::email_defaults_section_callback()`
- Modified method: `Omeda_Deployment_Types::render_settings_meta_box()` (added default value logic)
- Modified method: `Omeda_Deployment_Types::enqueue_admin_assets()` (simplified)
- Removed method: `Omeda_Deployment_Types::render_audience_query_dropdown()` (no longer needed)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the changes:**
   - Follow the testing guide in `docs/TESTING_GUIDE_1.4.0.md`
   - Test both with and without Omeda API credentials
   - Verify in different browsers

2. **Configure default settings:**
   - Go to **Omeda Integration** → **Settings**
   - Set your default From Name, From Email, and Reply To
   - These will be used for all new deployment types

3. **Create a test deployment type:**
   - Verify email fields are pre-populated
   - Verify audience query is a simple text field
   - Confirm Select2 dropdowns work for deployment type and post type

4. **Check existing deployment types:**
   - Verify they still have their original values
   - Confirm no data was lost or overwritten

## User Benefits

1. **Faster deployment type creation:** Email fields automatically populate with sensible defaults
2. **Consistency:** All deployment types can use the same email settings by default
3. **Flexibility:** Defaults can still be overridden for specific use cases
4. **Less repetitive data entry:** Set once, use everywhere
5. **Better UX:** Simplified audience query field with clear instructions
