# Development Session Summary

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Session Duration:** Approximately 4 hours  
**Developer:** AI Assistant with Josh Stogner  
**Plugin:** Omeda WordPress Integration

---

## Session Overview

This development session focused on implementing enhancements to the Omeda WordPress Integration plugin, with emphasis on improving user experience, adding WordPress variable support, and implementing draft deployment functionality based on user feedback and requirements.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Default Email Settings (v1.4.0)

**Goal:** Reduce repetitive data entry when creating deployment types

**Implementation:**
- Added three new global settings in the Settings page:
  - Default From Name
  - Default From Email  
  - Default Reply To Email
- Created new "Default Email Settings" section
- Auto-populate new deployment type forms with these defaults
- Defaults only apply to new deployment types (auto-draft status)
- Can be overridden per deployment type

**Files Modified:**
- `includes/class-omeda-settings.php` - Added settings fields and render methods
- `includes/class-omeda-deployment-types.php` - Added prepopulation logic

**User Benefit:**
- Faster deployment type creation
- Consistency across configurations
- Less room for error

---

### 2. WordPress Variable Support (v1.3.0)

**Goal:** Allow dynamic subject lines using WordPress post data

**Implementation:**
- Created `Omeda_Variable_Parser` class
- Supports 15+ WordPress variables in subject format field
- Variables include post data, author info, site info, taxonomies
- Compatible with existing Omeda merge tags
- Extensible via `omeda_parsed_variables` filter

**Supported Variables:**
```
{post_title}, {post_date}, {post_date_Y}, {post_date_m}, {post_date_d}
{post_date_F}, {post_date_M}, {author_name}, {author_first_name}
{author_last_name}, {site_name}, {site_tagline}, {category}
{categories}, {tags}, {excerpt}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `includes/class-omeda-variable-parser.php` - New file (parser class)
- `includes/class-omeda-workflow-manager.php` - Integrated parser
- `includes/class-omeda-deployment-types.php` - Updated field descriptions

**User Benefit:**
- Dynamic, personalized subject lines
- Reduced manual editing
- More engaging email subjects

---

### 3. Draft Deployment Creation (v1.5.0)

**Goal:** Create deployments immediately when saving drafts for faster testing

**Implementation:**
- Changed deployment date logic from far-future (2099) to next nearest hour
- Calculate next hour: `ceil(time() / 3600) * 3600`
- All 4 steps now run on first draft save:
  1. Create deployment in Omeda
  2. Assign audience
  3. Upload content and subject
  4. Store TrackID and log completion
- Deployment date updated to actual publish/schedule date when post published
- Enhanced workflow logging with clear step indicators

**Files Modified:**
- `includes/class-omeda-workflow-manager.php` - Updated date calculation logic
- `includes/class-omeda-hooks.php` - Minor comment updates

**User Benefit:**
- Immediate visibility in Omeda
- Validate configuration before publishing
- Faster feedback and testing
- More realistic temporary dates

---

### 4. UI Improvements

**Audience Query Field:**
- Reverted from Select2 dropdown to simple text input
- Rationale: Omeda doesn't provide API for listing queries
- Enhanced description with clearer instructions
- Added helpful placeholder text

**Deployment Type Dropdown:**
- Maintained Select2 for searchability
- Shows deployment type ID alongside name
- Only displays active types (StatusCode = 1)
- Refresh button for manual cache clear

**Post Type/Template Dropdown:**
- Select2 enabled for searchability
- Organized into optgroups:
  - Post Types
  - Newsletter Glue Enabled Post Types
  - Newsletter Glue Templates
  - Newsletter Glue Template Categories

---
