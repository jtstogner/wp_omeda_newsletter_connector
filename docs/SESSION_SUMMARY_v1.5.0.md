# Session Summary: Workflow Monitor Implementation

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Version:** 1.5.0  
**Focus:** Real-time workflow visibility and debugging capabilities

---

## Objective

Add comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities to the Omeda WordPress Integration plugin to provide transparency into workflow execution and help troubleshoot deployment issues.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Workflow Monitor Admin Page

**File:** `includes/class-omeda-workflow-monitor.php`

**Features:**
- System-wide view of all pending and scheduled workflow tasks
- Displays: Post ID, Post Title, Task Type, Scheduled Time, Status, Retry Count
- Works with both Action Scheduler (dev) and WP-Cron (production)
- Recent Workflow Logs section showing last 10 posts with activity
- Accessible via: **Omeda Integration → Workflow Monitor**

**Key Methods:**
- `add_menu_page()` - Registers admin menu
- `render_monitor_page()` - Main page rendering
- `get_all_pending_jobs()` - Fetches jobs from scheduler
- `render_jobs_table()` - Displays jobs in table format
- `render_recent_logs()` - Shows recent workflow logs
- `format_hook_name()` - Converts hook names to readable labels

### 2. Workflow Status Metabox

**Location:** Post edit screen sidebar

**Features:**
- Shows Omeda Track ID when deployment exists
- Lists all pending tasks for the current post
- Displays recent activity log (last 5 entries)
- Color-coded log levels (INFO: blue, WARN: orange, ERROR: red)
- Real-time updates as tasks are processed
- Appears on supported post types: `post`, `ngl_pattern`

**Key Methods:**
- `add_workflow_status_metabox()` - Registers metabox
- `render_workflow_status_metabox()` - Renders metabox content

### 3. Enhanced Async Jobs Class

**Updates to:** `includes/class-omeda-async-jobs.php`

**New Features:**
- `get_pending_jobs($post_id)` - Public method to fetch post-specific jobs
- `get_action_scheduler_jobs($post_id)` - Query Action Scheduler
- `get_wp_cron_jobs($post_id)` - Query WP-Cron
- Environment-aware job retrieval

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
Main Plugin (omeda-wp-integration.php)
    ↓
Workflow Monitor (class-omeda-workflow-monitor.php)
    ↓
Async Jobs (class-omeda-async-jobs.php)
    ↓
Action Scheduler / WP-Cron
```

### Scheduling Method Detection

```php
private function get_scheduling_method() {
    $is_production = (defined('WP_ENV') && WP_ENV === 'production') || 
                     wp_get_environment_type() === 'production';
    
    if ($is_production) {
        return 'wp_cron';
    } elseif (function_exists('as_schedule_single_action')) {
        return 'action_scheduler';
    }
    return 'sync';
}
```

### Job Data Structure

```php
[
    'post_id' => 123,
    'post_title' => 'My Article',
    'hook' => 'Create Deployment',
    'scheduled' => '2025-10-29 18:30:00',
    'status' => 'Pending',
    'retry_count' => 0
]
```

### Log Entry Format

```php
[
    'timestamp' => '2025-10-29 18:30:15',
    'level' => 'INFO',
    'message' => 'Step 1/5 Complete: Deployment created',
    'context' => [...]  // Additional debug info on errors
]
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Main Plugin File

**File:** `omeda-wp-integration.php`

**Changes:**
- Added `require_once` for monitor class
- Added `$workflow_monitor` property to main class
- Initialized monitor in constructor
- Bumped version to 1.5.0

### 2. Workflow Manager

**File:** `includes/class-omeda-workflow-manager.php`

**No changes required** - Already had comprehensive logging system in place that monitor taps into.

### 3. Async Jobs

**File:** `includes/class-omeda-async-jobs.php`

**Changes:**
- Added `get_pending_jobs()` method

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing

✅ Monitor page displays correctly  
✅ Empty state shows appropriate message  
✅ Jobs table renders with correct data  
✅ Post links work correctly  
✅ Recent logs section displays properly  
✅ Metabox appears on correct post types  
✅ Track ID displays when present  
✅ Pending tasks list correctly

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation

1. **No Task Cancellation:** Can't cancel scheduled tasks from UI
2. **No Manual Retry:** Must wait for automatic retry
3. **No Filtering:** Can't filter tasks by status/type
4. **No Search:** Can't search logs by keyword
5. **No Export:** Can't export logs for analysis

### By Design

1. **Pending Only:** Only shows scheduled/pending tasks, not completed
2. **Recent Logs:** Limited to last 10 posts on monitor page
3. **Static Display:** No auto-refresh (requires page reload)

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- Monitor page: `manage_options` capability (Administrators)
- Metabox: Edit post capability (Editors+)
- Logs: Not publicly accessible (post meta)
- API credentials: Never logged or displayed

### Data Privacy

- Track IDs: Safe to display (not sensitive)
- Post titles: Visible to authorized users only
- Configuration: No credentials in logs
- Error context: May contain API responses (sanitized)

---
