# Quick Fix Summary - Action Scheduler Not Executing Jobs

## What Was Wrong
When you saved a newsletter in wp-env, you saw:
```
[INFO] Deployment creation scheduled via Action Scheduler (executing immediately).
```
But nothing happened after that. The deployment wasn't created in Omeda.

## Why It Happened
Action Scheduler needs WordPress's cron system (WP-Cron) to run its queue. In wp-env (development), WP-Cron doesn't run automatically because there's no traffic. So jobs were being scheduled but never executed.

## What Was Fixed (v1.7.1)
Added code to manually trigger the Action Scheduler queue runner when a job needs immediate execution:

```php
// After scheduling a job with 0 delay, trigger the queue
if ($delay_seconds == 0) {
    $this->trigger_action_scheduler_queue();
}
```

This makes the queue process immediately instead of waiting for WP-Cron.

## How to Test
1. Create or edit a newsletter
2. Assign a deployment type
3. Save the draft
4. Check the workflow log in the Omeda metabox

**You should now see**:
- "Deployment creation scheduled (executing immediately)"
- "Executing: Create deployment job..."
- "Step 1/3 Complete: Deployment created with TrackID: 12345"
- "Executing: Assign audience job..."
- "Step 2/3 Complete: Audience assigned"
- "Executing: Add content job..."
- "Step 3/3 Complete: Initial content added"

**All within 3-5 seconds** of hitting save.

## Where to Look

### Check Workflow Logs
In the WordPress admin, edit any newsletter and scroll to the "Omeda Deployment" metabox in the sidebar. You'll see the workflow log at the bottom.

### Check Action Scheduler
Go to: Tools > Action Scheduler
- Pending jobs should process within seconds
- Completed jobs will show in the "Complete" tab

### Check Omeda Dashboard
Log into Omeda and verify the deployment exists with:
- Correct name
- Correct subject
- Correct deployment type
- Correct audience query

## Key Files Modified
- `src/omeda-newsletter-connector/includes/class-omeda-async-jobs.php` - Main fix
- `src/omeda-newsletter-connector/omeda-wp-integration.php` - Version bump to 1.7.1
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Release notes
- `docs/troubleshooting/action-scheduler-queue-execution.md` - Detailed explanation

## Production vs Development

### Development (wp-env, local)
Uses Action Scheduler with manual queue trigger for immediate execution

### Production
Can use either:
- **Action Scheduler** (if you want advanced features) - will use the same manual trigger
- **WP-Cron** (native WordPress) - uses `spawn_cron()` for immediate execution

The plugin automatically detects your environment and uses the right method.

## Next Steps
1. Test creating a new deployment
2. Verify it appears in Omeda immediately  
3. Try the "Send Test" button
4. Try the "Schedule" functionality
5. Monitor the first few deployments in production

## Rollback
If something goes wrong, revert to the previous commit:
```bash
git revert ed9740c
```

Or just checkout the previous version:
```bash
git checkout main~1
```
