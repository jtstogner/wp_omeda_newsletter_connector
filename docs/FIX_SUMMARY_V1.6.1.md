# Fix Summary: Newsletter Glue Workflow Support

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Version:** 1.6.1  
**Type:** Bug Fix (Patch Release)

## Problem
Workflow was not triggering when saving Newsletter Glue campaigns. The Omeda meta box appeared, but no workflow logs were generated and no deployment was created in Omeda.

## Root Cause
The `Omeda_Hooks` class only registered hooks for the standard WordPress `post` post type. Newsletter Glue uses a custom post type called `newsletterglue` for campaigns, which was not included in the supported types.

### Code Location
**File:** `src/omeda-newsletter-connector/includes/class-omeda-hooks.php`

**Method:** `get_supported_post_types()`

**Before (v1.6.0):**
```php
private function get_supported_post_types() {
    // Define which post types this integration supports
    return ['post'];
}
```

**After (v1.6.1):**
```php
private function get_supported_post_types() {
    // Define which post types this integration supports
    // 'post' for regular posts, 'newsletterglue' for Newsletter Glue campaigns
    return ['post', 'newsletterglue'];
}
```

## Impact

### What This Fixes
- ✅ Workflow now triggers for Newsletter Glue campaigns
- ✅ Workflow logs appear in meta box
- ✅ TrackID is generated and stored
- ✅ Deployment is created in Omeda
- ✅ Content and subject are sent to Omeda
- ✅ Audience is assigned correctly

### What Still Works
- ✅ Regular WordPress posts (backward compatible)
- ✅ All existing functionality unchanged
- ✅ Auto-detection of deployment types
- ✅ Status transitions (draft → publish)
- ✅ Async job scheduling

### What's Not Affected
- No database changes required
- No configuration changes needed
- No existing deployments affected
- No API changes
- No breaking changes

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test
1. Navigate to: Newsletter Glue → Campaigns (or create new campaign)
2. Edit any campaign
3. In sidebar, find "Omeda Deployment" meta box
4. Select a deployment type from dropdown
5. Click "Save Draft"
6. **Expected Result:** Workflow logs appear showing 4-step process
7. **Expected Result:** TrackID displayed at top of meta box

### Detailed Verification

#### Step 1: Check Meta Box Appears
- Open any Newsletter Glue campaign
- Look for "Omeda Deployment" meta box in right sidebar
- Should be positioned near top (high priority)

#### Step 2: Select Deployment Type
- Click dropdown in meta box
- Should see list of your deployment types
- Select one (e.g., "Just Josh")
- Or leave as "Auto-Detect" if configured

#### Step 3: Save Draft
- Click "Save Draft" button
- Page will reload
- Check meta box for workflow logs

#### Step 4: Verify Logs
Look for these log entries (in order):

```
[INFO] Workflow Initiated: Post saved as draft with a Deployment Type.
[INFO] Step 1/4 Complete: Deployment created with TrackID: [number]
[INFO] Step 2/4 Complete: Audience assigned.
[INFO] Step 3/4 Complete: Content and subject sent to Omeda.
[INFO] Step 4/4 Complete: Initial deployment setup complete. Scheduled for [date] UTC (temporary date - will update when published).
```

#### Step 5: Check TrackID
- Look for "Omeda TrackID: [number]" above the logs
- This number is your Omeda deployment ID
- Copy it for verification in Omeda

#### Step 6: Verify in Omeda
- Log into Omeda platform
- Navigate to Deployments section
- Search for the TrackID
- Confirm deployment exists with:
  - Correct subject line
  - Correct from name/email
  - Assigned audience
  - HTML content

### Alternative: Use WP-CLI

#### Check if post type is correct:
```bash
wp-env run cli wp post get [POST_ID] --field=post_type
```
Expected: `newsletterglue`

#### Check for workflow logs:
```bash
wp-env run cli wp post meta get [POST_ID] _omeda_workflow_log
```
Should return JSON log entries.

#### Check for TrackID:
```bash
wp-env run cli wp post meta get [POST_ID] _omeda_track_id
```
Should return a number.

## Common Issues After Update

### Issue: Still not working
**Solution:** Clear any caching
```bash
wp-env run cli wp cache flush
```

### Issue: Meta box doesn't appear
**Check:** Plugin is active
```bash
wp-env run cli wp plugin list
```
Look for `omeda-newsletter-connector` with status `active`.

### Issue: Deployment type dropdown empty
**Check:** API credentials configured
- Go to: Omeda Integration → Settings
- Verify: API App ID, Brand Abbreviation, Environment

### Issue: Error in logs
**Check:** `wp-content/debug.log` for details
Enable debugging in `wp-config.php`:
```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```

## Technical Details

### Hook Registration
Hooks are registered in `Omeda_Hooks::init()`:

```php
public function init() {
    add_action('add_meta_boxes', array($this, 'register_meta_boxes'));
    add_action('save_post', array($this, 'handle_post_save'), 5, 1);
    add_action('transition_post_status', array($this, 'handle_status_transition'), 10, 3);
}
```

### Meta Box Registration
Meta boxes are added for each supported post type:

```php
public function register_meta_boxes() {
    foreach ($this->get_supported_post_types() as $post_type) {
        add_meta_box(
            'omeda_integration_box',
            'Omeda Deployment',
            array($this, 'render_meta_box'),
            $post_type,  // Now includes 'newsletterglue'
            'side',
            'high'
        );
    }
}
```

### Save Hook Filter
Save hooks include post type check:

```php
public function handle_post_save($post_id) {
    // ... security checks ...
    
    if (!in_array(get_post_type($post_id), $this->get_supported_post_types())) {
        return;  // Would have returned early for 'newsletterglue' in v1.6.0
    }
    
    // ... workflow continues ...
}
```
