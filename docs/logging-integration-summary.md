# Logging Integration Summary - v1.10.0

## Date: 2025-10-29

## Overview
Successfully integrated comprehensive logging into the Omeda API Client to solve circular dependency issues and provide detailed request/response logging for debugging.

## Problem Statement
You wanted to add workflow manager logging to the API client class for advanced logging, but encountered circular dependency issues since the API client is required by the workflow manager.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Context Tracking in API Client
Added context tracking methods to the API client:
- `set_post_context($post_id, $step)` - Sets the current post ID and workflow step before API calls
- `clear_post_context()` - Clears context after operations complete
- These allow the API client to know which post and workflow step is making the call

### 2. Integrated Logging in send_request()
The API client's `send_request()` method now automatically logs:

**Before the request:**
- HTTP method, full URL, headers, and request body
- Logged at RAW level for detailed inspection
- Uses `Omeda_Logger::log_api_request()`

**After the request:**
- HTTP status code, response body, and response headers  
- Logged at RAW level for detailed inspection
- Uses `Omeda_Logger::log_api_response()`

**On errors:**
- Comprehensive error details including request and response data
- Uses `Omeda_Logger::log_api_error()`

### 3. Workflow Manager Integration
Updated workflow manager to set context before each API operation:

```php
// Example pattern used throughout
$this->api_client->set_post_context($post_id, 'create_deployment');
Omeda_Logger::log($post_id, 'INFO', 'Creating deployment...', 'create_deployment');

try {
    $result = $this->api_client->step1_create_deployment($config);
    Omeda_Logger::log($post_id, 'INFO', 'Deployment created successfully.', 'create_deployment');
    $this->api_client->clear_post_context();
} catch (Exception $e) {
    Omeda_Logger::log($post_id, 'ERROR', 'Deployment creation failed: ' . $e->getMessage(), 'create_deployment');
    $this->api_client->clear_post_context();
}
```

Applied to all workflow steps:
- `create_deployment`
- `assign_audience`  
- `add_content`
- `send_test`
- `schedule_deployment`

### 4. Files Modified

**API Client** (`class-omeda-api-client.php`):
- Added `current_post_id` and `current_step` properties
- Added `set_post_context()` and `clear_post_context()` methods
- Enhanced `send_request()` with automatic logging
- No circular dependencies - uses logger directly

**Workflow Manager** (`class-omeda-workflow-manager.php`):
- Updated all API call sites to set/clear context
- Removed duplicate/orphaned logging code
- Fixed syntax errors
- Cleaner error handling

**Main Plugin File** (`omeda-wp-integration.php`):
- Updated version to 1.10.0
- Added logger include before other classes

## Benefits

1. **No Circular Dependencies**: API client logs directly without needing workflow manager
2. **Automatic Logging**: All API requests/responses logged automatically
3. **Better Context**: Logs clearly show which post and step made each API call
4. **Easier Debugging**: Raw request/response data visible in workflow logs
5. **Centralized**: All API logging happens in one place (send_request method)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Create a new newsletter deployment
2. Check workflow logs to verify:
   - Each step shows "Starting [step] transaction..."
   - RAW logs show full request payloads
   - RAW logs show full response data
   - Error logs include both request sent and response received
   
3. Intentionally trigger an error (e.g., bad audience query) and verify:
   - Error message is clear
   - Request payload is visible
   - Response error details are visible

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Log level filtering in the workflow log viewer
- Ability to download logs as JSON for external analysis
- Performance metrics (API call duration)
- Request/response data redaction for sensitive fields
