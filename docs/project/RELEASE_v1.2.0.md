# Version 1.2.0 Release Summary

**Release Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Type:** Minor Release (New Features)  
**Previous Version:** 1.1.1

## Quick Summary

Added searchable dropdowns using Select2 for deployment types and post types, significantly improving UX when working with long lists. Enhanced the audience query name field with better guidance and examples.

## What's New

### ✅ Searchable Dropdowns (Select2 Integration)

**Deployment Type Dropdown:**
- Type to search through Omeda deployment types
- Clear button to reset selection
- Professional UI with better keyboard navigation
- Full-width responsive design

**Post Type/Template Dropdown:**
- Search through all post types and Newsletter Glue templates
- Organized optgroups for better categorization
- Same Select2 features as deployment type dropdown

### ✅ Enhanced Query Name Field

**Improvements:**
- Added helpful placeholder: "My Audience Builder Query"
- Enhanced description explaining Omeda Audience Builder integration
- Clear note that queries must match exact name from Omeda
- Case-sensitivity warning included

### ❌ Why No Dropdown for Audience Queries?

**Omeda API Limitation:**
- No API endpoint exists to list audience queries

- Must be referenced by exact name string

**Solution:**
- Text input with helpful examples and guidance
- Documentation on how to find query names in Omeda
- Future: Could add autocomplete from historical usage
