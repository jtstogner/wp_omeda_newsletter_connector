# Hybrid Scheduling Implementation - Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Final Implementation

### Decision
Per user requirement: "For testing I don't mind using Action Scheduler. For production I'd rather keep it purely WordPress. We have enough traffic that during the hours these functions will be performed they will keep the cron alive."

### Solution Implemented
**Hybrid approach with automatic environment detection:**

```php
private function get_scheduling_method() {
    $is_production = (defined('WP_ENV') && WP_ENV === 'production') || 
                     wp_get_environment_type() === 'production';
    
    if ($is_production) {
        return 'wp_cron';  // Production: Native WordPress
    } else {
        return function_exists('as_schedule_single_action') ? 'action_scheduler' : 'sync';
    }
}
```

## Environment Behavior

### Development/Staging (wp-env)
- **Uses:** Action Scheduler
- **Why:** Reliable execution without site traffic
- **Benefits:**
  - Jobs execute reliably
  - Admin UI for debugging
  - No manual cron triggering needed
  - Better development experience

### Production
- **Uses:** Native WP-Cron
- **Why:** Pure WordPress standard, no external dependencies
- **Requirements Met:**
  - Sufficient traffic during operating hours
  - WP-Cron stays alive with consistent traffic
  - Zero external dependencies
  - WordPress-native only

## Code Changes

### Modified File: `class-omeda-async-jobs.php`

**Added Methods:**
1. `get_scheduling_method()` - Environment detection
2. `schedule_with_action_scheduler()` - Action Scheduler scheduling
3. `schedule_with_wp_cron()` - WP-Cron scheduling
4. `finalize_with_action_scheduler()` - AS finalization sequence
5. `finalize_with_wp_cron()` - WP-Cron finalization sequence
6. `cancel_action_scheduler_jobs()` - AS job cancellation (debouncing)
7. `cancel_wp_cron_jobs()` - WP-Cron job cancellation (debouncing)
8. `get_action_scheduler_jobs()` - Query AS pending jobs
9. `get_wp_cron_jobs()` - Query WP-Cron pending jobs

**Updated Methods:**
- `schedule_create_deployment()` - Now routes to correct scheduler
- `schedule_update_content()` - Now routes to correct scheduler
- `schedule_finalize_deployment()` - Now routes to correct scheduler
- `handle_job_error()` - Retry logic works with both schedulers
- `get_pending_jobs()` - Returns jobs from active scheduler

## WP-Cron Implementation Details

### Scheduling
```php
wp_schedule_single_event(time() + $delay, $hook, $args);
```

### Debouncing
Iterates through `_get_cron_array()` to find and cancel matching jobs by post_id.

### Job Retrieval
Queries `_get_cron_array()` to find pending jobs for a specific post.

## Benefits of This Approach

### For Development
✅ Action Scheduler ensures reliable execution  
✅ Admin UI for monitoring and debugging  
✅ No manual intervention needed  
✅ Works perfectly in wp-env

### For Production
✅ Pure WordPress (WP-Cron only)  
✅ Zero external dependencies  
✅ Follows WordPress-native standards  
✅ Reliable with sufficient traffic  
✅ Simpler deployment

### Universal
✅ Same codebase for all environments  
✅ Automatic detection and routing  
✅ Both schedulers use same job handlers  
✅ Consistent logging and error handling  
✅ Debouncing works in both modes

## Testing

### Development Testing (wp-env)
```bash
# Start environment
npx wp-env start

# Verify Action Scheduler is active
npx wp-env run cli wp eval 'echo wp_get_environment_type();'
# Should output: local or development

# Jobs will use Action Scheduler
# View in admin: Omeda Integration → Background Jobs
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# Set environment to production
# In wp-config.php:
define('WP_ENV', 'production');

# Or use wp_get_environment_type() configuration
# Jobs will automatically use WP-Cron

# View scheduled jobs
wp cron event list
```

## Environment Detection

### WordPress 5.5+
Uses `wp_get_environment_type()` which returns:
- `local` - Development (uses Action Scheduler)
- `development` - Development (uses Action Scheduler)
- `staging` - Staging (uses Action Scheduler)
- `production` - Production (uses WP-Cron)

### Legacy Support
Falls back to `WP_ENV` constant if set.

### Override (if needed)
Can add filter for manual override:
```php
add_filter('omeda_scheduling_method', function($method) {
    return 'wp_cron'; // Force WP-Cron
});
```

## What This Means

### In wp-env (Development)
- Jobs scheduled with Action Scheduler
- Logs show: "scheduled via Action Scheduler"
- Admin UI available for monitoring
- Reliable execution

### In Production
- Jobs scheduled with WP-Cron
- Logs show: "scheduled via WP-Cron"
- Uses standard WordPress cron system
- No external dependencies

## Documentation Updated

- ✅ `WORKLOG.md` - Added hybrid approach notes
- ✅ `PRODUCTION_WPCRON_PLAN.md` - Implementation plan
- ✅ `HYBRID_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This document

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Environment detection working
- [x] Action Scheduler path implemented
- [x] WP-Cron path implemented
- [x] Debouncing works in both modes
- [x] Retry logic works in both modes
- [x] Job retrieval works in both modes
- [x] Logging shows correct scheduler
- [x] Same job handlers for both
- [x] Backward compatible
- [x] Production-ready

---

**Result:** Production uses pure WordPress (WP-Cron), development uses Action Scheduler. Best of both worlds achieved. ✅
