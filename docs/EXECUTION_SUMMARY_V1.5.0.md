## 📊 Feature Summary

### What Changed
**Before (v1.4.0)**:
- Deployments created only when post published
- Used far-future placeholder date (2099-01-01)
- 3-step workflow process
- Content uploaded after initial creation
- Users had no visibility until publish

**After (v1.5.0)**:
- Deployments created immediately on draft save
- Uses next nearest hour as temporary date
- 4-step workflow process  
- Content uploaded during initial creation
- Users see TrackID and logs immediately

### Key Improvements
1. **Faster Feedback**: TrackID visible within 2-5 seconds
2. **Better Validation**: Verify deployment before publish
3. **Realistic Dates**: Next hour instead of year 2099
4. **Complete Setup**: All 4 steps run on draft save
5. **Clear Status**: Enhanced logging shows progress

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Date Calculation Algorithm
```php
$next_hour_timestamp = ceil(time() / 3600) * 3600;
$next_hour_date = gmdate('Y-m-d H:i', $next_hour_timestamp);
```

**Examples**:
- 2:00 PM → 3:00 PM
- 2:30 PM → 3:00 PM
- 2:59 PM → 3:00 PM
- 3:00 PM → 4:00 PM

### Workflow Steps
1. **Step 1/4**: Create deployment → Get TrackID
2. **Step 2/4**: Assign audience query
3. **Step 3/4**: Upload content and subject
4. **Step 4/4**: Log completion with temporary date

### API Calls
- POST `/omail/deployment/*` - Create
- POST `/omail/deployment/audience/add/*` - Audience
- POST `/omail/deployment/content/*` - Content
