# Implementation Summary: Draft Deployment Creation (v1.5.0)

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Version**: 1.5.0  
**Feature**: Immediate deployment creation on draft save

---

## What Was Changed

### Core Functionality
Changed the deployment workflow to create deployments in Omeda immediately when a draft is saved, rather than waiting for publish. This provides faster feedback and better validation capabilities.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Workflow Manager (`class-omeda-workflow-manager.php`)
**Method**: `create_and_assign_audience()`

**Old Behavior**:
```php
// Used far-future placeholder date
$config = $this->prepare_configuration($post_id, $config_id, '2099-01-01 12:00');

// 3-step process
$this->log_status($post_id, "Step 1/3 Complete: ...");
$this->log_status($post_id, 'Step 2/3 Complete: ...');
$this->update_content(...); // Called as separate method
```

**New Behavior**:
```php
// Calculate next nearest hour
$next_hour_timestamp = ceil(time() / 3600) * 3600;
$next_hour_date = gmdate('Y-m-d H:i', $next_hour_timestamp);
$config = $this->prepare_configuration($post_id, $config_id, $next_hour_date);

// 4-step process with immediate content upload
$this->log_status($post_id, "Step 1/4 Complete: Deployment created...");
$this->log_status($post_id, 'Step 2/4 Complete: Audience assigned.');
$this->api_client->step3_add_content($track_id, $config);
$this->log_status($post_id, 'Step 3/4 Complete: Content and subject sent...');
$this->log_status($post_id, "Step 4/4 Complete: Initial deployment setup complete. Scheduled for {$next_hour_date} UTC...");
```

**Why Changed**:
- More realistic temporary date (next hour vs. year 2099)
- All setup steps complete on draft save
- Better user feedback with 4-step process
- Content uploaded immediately for validation

#### 2. Plugin Version (`omeda-wp-integration.php`)
```php
// Old
define('OMEDA_WP_VERSION', '1.4.0');

// New
define('OMEDA_WP_VERSION', '1.5.0');
```

**Why Changed**: Minor version bump for new feature addition

#### 3. Changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`)
Added comprehensive v1.5.0 entry documenting:
- New draft deployment creation feature
- Updated deployment date logic
- Enhanced workflow logging
- Technical implementation details
- Benefits and migration notes

#### 4. Documentation (`DRAFT_DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW.md`)
Created extensive documentation covering:
- How the workflow works
- Step-by-step process
- Deployment date logic
- Admin interface examples
- Benefits and best practices
- Troubleshooting guide
- Technical details

## What This Accomplishes

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Immediate Feedback**
   - TrackID appears right after saving draft
   - Users see deployment was created successfully
   - No waiting until publish to verify setup

2. **Early Validation**
   - Can check deployment exists in Omeda Email Builder
   - Verify content rendering before publish
   - Confirm audience assignment worked
   - Test email metadata (from, subject, reply-to)

3. **Iterative Workflow**
   - Edit and save multiple times
   - Content automatically updates in Omeda
   - See changes reflected immediately
   - No need to delete/recreate deployments

4. **Better Testing**
   - Send test emails during draft phase
   - Verify tracking links before publish
   - Catch issues early
   - More time for review and approval

### Technical Improvements

1. **Realistic Dates**
   - Next nearest hour instead of year 2099
   - Example: Saved at 2:30 PM → Date set to 3:00 PM
   - Easier to identify draft deployments
   - More meaningful for testing

2. **Complete Setup**
   - All 4 steps run on draft save:
     1. Create deployment
     2. Assign audience
     3. Upload content and subject
     4. Log completion
   - Deployment ready immediately
   - No waiting for publish to complete setup

3. **Clear Status**
   - 4-step logging shows progress
   - Each step has clear confirmation message
   - Final message explains temporary date
   - Users understand what happened

## Implementation Details

### Date Calculation Algorithm

```php
/**
 * Calculate next nearest hour from current time
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - 2:00 PM → 3:00 PM (round up)
 * - 2:15 PM → 3:00 PM (round up)
 * - 2:30 PM → 3:00 PM (round up)
 * - 2:45 PM → 3:00 PM (round up)
 * - 3:00 PM → 4:00 PM (already at hour, go next)
 */
$next_hour_timestamp = ceil(time() / 3600) * 3600;
$next_hour_date = gmdate('Y-m-d H:i', $next_hour_timestamp);
```

**How It Works**:
1. `time()` - Get current Unix timestamp
2. `/ 3600` - Convert seconds to hours
3. `ceil()` - Round up to next integer hour
4. `* 3600` - Convert back to seconds
5. `gmdate()` - Format as GMT/UTC date string

**Why GMT/UTC**: Consistent with Omeda API timezone requirements

### Workflow Sequence

```
User Action: Save Draft
    ↓
WordPress Hook: save_post
    ↓
Omeda Hooks: handle_post_save()
    ↓
Check: Has TrackID?
    ├─ NO → Create new deployment
    │   ↓
    │   Workflow Manager: create_and_assign_audience()
    │       ↓
    │       1. Calculate next hour date
    │       2. Prepare configuration
    │       3. API: Create deployment → Get TrackID
    │       4. API: Assign audience
    │       5. API: Upload content (NEW)
    │       6. Log: 4 completion messages (NEW)
    │       ↓
    │   Save TrackID to post meta
    │
    └─ YES → Update existing deployment
        ↓
        Workflow Manager: update_content()
            ↓
            1. API: Update content
            2. Log: Content updated
```

### API Calls Made

On draft save with new deployment:

1. **POST** `/omail/deployment/*`
   ```json
   {
     "DeploymentName": "Post Title",
     "DeploymentDate": "2025-10-29 15:00",
     "DeploymentTypeId": 123,
     "OwnerUserId": "user@example.com",
     "Splits": 1,
     "TrackLinks": 1,
     "TrackOpens": 1
   }
   ```
   Response: `{"TrackId": "ABC123456789"}`

2. **POST** `/omail/deployment/audience/add/*`
   ```json
   {
     "TrackId": "ABC123456789",
     "QueryName": "My Newsletter Audience",
     "OutputCriteria": "Newsletter_Member_id",
     "SplitNumber": 1
   }
   ```

3. **POST** `/omail/deployment/content/*`
   ```xml
   <Deployment>
     <TrackId>ABC123456789</TrackId>
     <UserId>user@example.com</UserId>
     <Splits>
       <Split>
         <SplitNumber>1</SplitNumber>
         <FromName>Newsletter Name</FromName>
         <FromEmail>newsletter@example.com</FromEmail>
         <Subject>Article Title</Subject>
         <ReplyTo>reply@example.com</ReplyTo>
         <HtmlContent><![CDATA[...]]></HtmlContent>
       </Split>
     </Splits>
   </Deployment>
   ```

### Post Meta Stored

| Key | Example Value | When Set |
|-----|---------------|----------|
| `_omeda_config_id` | `142` (Post ID) | On draft save (if deployment type selected) |
| `_omeda_track_id` | `ABC123456789` | After successful deployment creation |
| `_omeda_workflow_log` | JSON array | Throughout workflow (append-only) |

**Example Log Entry**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-29 14:30:15",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Step 1/4 Complete: Deployment created with TrackID: ABC123456789",
  "context": null
}
```

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Manual Date Override**
   - Allow users to set custom temporary date
   - Date picker in meta box
   - Override next-hour calculation

2. **Draft Preview**
   - Preview deployment in WordPress
   - Show rendered content
   - Verify merge tags work

3. **Content Diff Viewer**
   - Show changes since last save
   - Highlight modified sections
   - Track revision history

4. **Batch Operations**
   - Update multiple drafts at once
   - Bulk deployment creation
   - Mass content updates

5. **Status Indicators**
   - Visual deployment status
   - Color-coded workflow steps
   - Progress bars

### Known Limitations

1. **Date Accuracy**
   - Temporary date always rounds to next hour
   - Cannot be more granular than 1 hour
   - Always uses GMT/UTC timezone

2. **Content Size**
   - Large content may timeout
   - No streaming upload
   - No compression

3. **Network Dependencies**
   - Requires Omeda API available
   - No offline mode
   - No queuing if API down

4. **Validation**
   - No pre-flight content checks
   - No HTML validation
   - No merge tag verification

## Support and Maintenance

### Monitoring

Watch for:
- API timeout errors on draft save
- Failed deployment creation
- Content update failures
- Unexpected TrackID duplicates

### Logging

Check workflow logs for:
- All 4 steps completing
- Correct TrackID format
- Expected date calculations
- No error messages

### Troubleshooting

Common issues:
1. No TrackID after save → Check API credentials
2. Content not updated → Check workflow logs
3. Wrong deployment date → Verify timezone settings
4. Duplicate deployments → Check debouncing
