                            [Error] => The specific error message from Omeda will be here
                        )
                )
        )
)
```

## What to Look For

### 1. In the Request Payload
- [ ] Is TrackId present and correct?
- [ ] Is UserId present?
- [ ] Are FromName, Mailbox, Subject, ReplyTo all filled in?
- [ ] Is HtmlContent present and properly encoded in CDATA?
- [ ] Is the XML structure valid?

### 2. In the Response Body
- [ ] What is the specific error message?
- [ ] Does it mention a missing field?
- [ ] Does it mention invalid format?
- [ ] Does it mention authentication issues?

### 3. Common Issues to Check

#### Missing Required Field
If error says: `"Field 'XXX' is required"`
- Check if that field exists in request_payload
- Verify it has a value (not empty)

#### Invalid XML Format
If error says: `"Invalid XML"` or `"Parse error"`
- Check for unescaped special characters
- Verify CDATA sections are properly closed
- Look for < > & characters outside CDATA

#### Authentication Error
If error says: `"Invalid credentials"` or `"Unauthorized"`
- Check if x-omeda-appid header is being sent
- Verify API key is correct in settings

#### Content Too Large
If error says: `"Content too large"` or similar
- Check content_length in request details
- May need to compress or truncate content

## Reporting Results

When you see the error, please share:

1. **The exact error message** from Omeda (in response_body)
2. **The request_payload** (XML being sent) - can redact sensitive data
3. **Any patterns** you notice (does it happen with all newsletters or specific ones?)

## Example Good Report

```
Error Message: "Field 'UserId' is required"

Request shows:
- TrackId: MTGMCD251029012 ‚úì
- UserId: (empty!) ‚úó
- FromName: Test Name ‚úì
- Subject: Test Subject ‚úì

Issue: UserId field is not being populated in the deployment configuration.
```

## Next Steps After Test

1. ‚úÖ **If you can now see the error details**: Great! Share them so we can fix the root cause
2. ‚ùå **If you still don't see the RAW log entry**: Let me know, there may be a caching issue
3. ‚ùì **If error is unclear**: Share the full context and we'll interpret it together

## Useful Commands

### Check Debug Log
```bash
tail -f /home/jts/development/NRS/Projects/wp_omeda_newsletter_connector/wp-content/debug.log
```

### Clear Cache (if needed)
In WordPress Admin:
- Settings ‚Üí Omeda Settings
- Click "Clear All Caches"

### View Raw Logs in Database
```sql
SELECT post_id, meta_value 
FROM wp_postmeta 
WHERE meta_key = '_omeda_workflow_log' 
ORDER BY meta_id DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```
