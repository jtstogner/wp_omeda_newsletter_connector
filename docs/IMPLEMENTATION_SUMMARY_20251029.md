# Implementation Summary - Enhanced Logging System

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Version:** 1.11.0
**Task:** Add comprehensive logging for request/response debugging

## Problem Statement

User reported that content is not being assigned to Omeda deployments (HTTP 400 errors), but log entries only showed:

```
[ERROR] Content assignment failed: Omeda API Error (HTTP 400)
```

Without seeing:
- What data was sent to Omeda
- What exact error Omeda returned
- Which fields were invalid
- The complete API response

This made it impossible to diagnose why content assignment was failing.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Three-Level Logging System

Added configurable logging levels accessible via Settings page:

#### Basic Level (Default - Production Safe)
- Main workflow steps (creating deployment, assigning audience, adding content)
- Error summaries
- Retry attempts
- Step completion messages
- Suitable for production environments

#### Advanced Level (Detailed Troubleshooting)
- Everything in Basic level
- Transaction start/stop markers
- Step restart indicators
- Detailed error messages with context
- Structured error information
- Suitable for development/staging troubleshooting

#### Raw Level (Complete Debugging)
- Everything in Advanced level
- Full request payloads sent to Omeda
- Complete response bodies from Omeda
- API URLs and endpoints
- HTTP headers (sanitized)
- Data dumps for deep debugging
- **WARNING: May contain sensitive data - use only in development**

### 2. Enhanced API Client Logging

**File:** `class-omeda-api-client.php`

**Changes:**
- Added conditional logging based on `omeda_logging_level` option
- Logs complete request details: URL, method, headers, body
- Logs complete response details: HTTP code, body
- Sanitizes sensitive headers (API keys) in logs
- Truncates large payloads to 5000 chars to prevent log bloat
- Uses `error_log()` to write to WordPress debug log

**Example Output (Raw Level):**
```
=== Omeda API Request ===
URL: https://ows.omedastaging.com/webservices/rest/brand/MTGMCD/omail/deployment/content/*
Method: POST
Headers: {"x-omeda-appid":"***","Content-Type":"application/xml"}
Body: <OmedaAPIResponse>...</OmedaAPIResponse>

=== Omeda API Response ===
HTTP Code: 400
Body: {"Errors":[{"Error":"HTML content must include unsubscribe link"}]}
```

### 3. Structured Error Handling

**File:** `class-omeda-async-jobs.php`

**Changes:**
- Parse structured error responses from API client
- Extract all error components:
  - Error summary
  - Endpoint name
  - Full URL
  - HTTP method
  - HTTP status code
  - Request payload
  - Response body
- Log individual Omeda error messages
- Include all context in RAW logs

**Example Output:**
```
[ERROR] Content assignment failed: Omeda API Error (HTTP 400): Invalid HTML content
  → Endpoint: omail/deployment/content/*
  → Omeda Error: HTML content must include unsubscribe link
  → Omeda Error: Subject line exceeds 255 characters
[RAW] API Error Details:
  URL: https://ows.omedastaging.com/...
  Method: POST
  HTTP Code: 400
  Request: {"TrackId":"MTGMCD251029011","HtmlBody":"..."}
  Response: {"Errors":[...]}
```

### 4. Settings Page Integration

**File:** `class-omeda-settings.php`

**Changes:**
- Added new settings field: `omeda_logging_level`
- Created `render_logging_level_field()` method
- Dropdown with three options: basic, advanced, raw
- Comprehensive descriptions explaining each level
- Warnings about sensitive data in raw logs
- Located in "Workflow Configuration" section

### 5. Documentation

Created three comprehensive documentation files:

#### `DEPLOYMENT_DEBUG_GUIDE.md`
- Complete troubleshooting guide
- How to use each logging level
- Step-by-step debugging instructions
- Common issues and solutions
- API endpoint reference
- Examples of what to look for in logs

#### `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.11.0.md`
- User-friendly release notes
- Quick start guide
- Benefits overview
- Upgrade instructions
- Testing checklist

#### `CHANGELOG.md` (Updated)
- Technical changelog entry
- Detailed list of changes
- Migration notes
- Benefits summary

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Logging (Production Mode)
1. Go to **Omeda Integration → Settings**
2. Set **Logging Level** to **Basic**
3. Save settings
4. Create/update a newsletter
5. Go to **Workflow Logs**
6. Verify you see main steps only:
   - `[INFO] Creating deployment...`
   - `[INFO] Step 1/3 Complete: Deployment created`
   - `[ERROR] Content assignment failed: Omeda API Error (HTTP 400)`

### Test 2: Advanced Logging (Troubleshooting Mode)
1. Set **Logging Level** to **Advanced**
2. Create/update a newsletter
3. Verify you see transaction traces:
   - `[DEBUG] Starting content addition transaction...`
   - `[INFO] Sending content (14291 chars) to Omeda...`
   - `[ERROR] Content assignment failed: [detailed error]`
   - `[DEBUG] Content addition transaction failed.`

### Test 3: Raw Logging (Debug Mode)
1. Set **Logging Level** to **Raw**
2. Create/update a newsletter
3. Check **Workflow Logs** for RAW entries
4. Expand **View Details** to see:
   - Complete request payload
   - Full response body
5. Check `/wp-content/debug.log` for:
   - `=== Omeda API Request ===`
   - Full URL, headers, body
   - `=== Omeda API Response ===`
   - HTTP code and response

### Test 4: Error Context
1. With Raw logging enabled
2. Trigger a content assignment error
3. Verify error log includes:
   - Error summary
   - Endpoint URL
   - HTTP status code
   - Request data sent
   - Response received
   - Individual Omeda error messages

## Usage Guide

### For Developers

**Daily Development:**
- Use **Advanced** level
- Gets detailed traces without raw data dumps
- Good balance of information and performance

**Debugging Specific Issues:**
- Use **Raw** level temporarily
- See exact API requests/responses
- Switch back to Advanced when done

### For Production

**Normal Operations:**
- Use **Basic** level
- Minimal log size
- Essential information only
- No sensitive data exposure

**Customer Support:**
- Switch to **Advanced** temporarily
- Reproduce customer issue
- Gather detailed information
- Switch back to Basic

**Deep Debugging:**
- Use **Raw** only if absolutely necessary
- Be aware of sensitive data in logs
- Switch back immediately after diagnosis

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Immediate Visibility**: Can now see what's being sent to Omeda
2. **Faster Debugging**: Complete error context available
3. **Production Safe**: Basic level doesn't expose sensitive data
4. **Flexible**: Can adjust detail level without code changes
5. **Better Support**: More information for troubleshooting
