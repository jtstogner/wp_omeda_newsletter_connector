# Omeda Integration - Version 1.8.0 Summary

## What Was Fixed

The deployment creation workflow was not executing - deployments weren't appearing in Omeda when you saved a newsletter draft.

## Root Cause

Action Scheduler's queue runner doesn't process jobs immediately during the same HTTP request, even when scheduled with 0 delay. The jobs were sitting in the queue waiting for WP-Cron to trigger, which could take minutes or never happen in development environments.

## Solution

Changed immediate operations (0 delay) to execute synchronously during the save request:

1. **Draft Save → Deployment Creation**: Now runs synchronously
   - Creates deployment in Omeda
   - Assigns audience
   - Sends initial content
   - All in one request

2. **Draft Update → Content Update**: Now runs synchronously
   - Updates HTML content in Omeda
   - Happens immediately when you save

## What Still Uses Async

Only truly delayed/debounced operations use async scheduling:
- Operations with explicit delays
- Production environment with WP-Cron
- Any operation scheduled for future execution

## Testing Steps

1. **Create new newsletter**:
   ```
   - Select deployment type
   - Save draft
   - Check workflow logs → should show all 3 steps complete immediately:
     * Step 1/3: Deployment created
     * Step 2/3: Audience assigned  
     * Step 3/3: Content added
   ```

2. **Verify in Omeda**:
   ```
   - Log into Omeda Email Builder
   - Search for deployment by TrackID (shown in WordPress)
   - Verify audience is assigned
   - Verify HTML content is present
   ```

3. **Update content**:
   ```
   - Modify newsletter HTML
   - Save draft
   - Check workflow logs → should show content update complete
   - Verify in Omeda that content updated
   ```

## Files Changed

1. **src/omeda-newsletter-connector/includes/class-omeda-async-jobs.php**
   - Updated `schedule_create_deployment()` - execute sync when delay = 0
   - Updated `schedule_update_content()` - execute sync when delay = 0
   - Updated `handle_create_deployment()` - directly calls `handle_assign_audience()`
   - Updated `handle_assign_audience()` - directly calls `handle_add_content()`

2. **src/omeda-newsletter-connector/omeda-wp-integration.php**
   - Version updated to 1.8.0

3. **CHANGELOG.md**
   - Added version 1.8.0 entry with full details

4. **docs/FIXES_20251029.md** (new)
   - Comprehensive technical documentation
   - Root cause analysis
   - API endpoint verification
   - Testing recommendations

## Quick Reference

**Version**: 1.8.0  
**Type**: Minor release (bug fix + architecture change)  
**Breaking Changes**: None  
**Migration Required**: No  

## Next Steps

1. Test deployment creation with actual newsletter
2. Verify deployments appear in Omeda immediately
3. Test content updates
4. Send test email using new "Send Test" button
5. Schedule deployment using new scheduler interface

## Notes

- Timestamps already included in workflow logs (feature was already implemented)
- All Omeda API endpoints verified against official documentation
- Synchronous execution improves reliability and user experience
- No database changes required
