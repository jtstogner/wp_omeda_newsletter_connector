## Important Question About WP-Cron

You asked:
> "don't we already have a built in cron system? do we need action-scheduler?"

**Short Answer:** Yes, WordPress has WP-Cron, but Action Scheduler is **strongly recommended** for your wp-env environment.

**Critical Issue with WP-Cron in wp-env:**
- WP-Cron requires site traffic to trigger
- In wp-env development, jobs may NEVER execute without visitors
- You'd need to manually trigger: `curl http://localhost:8888/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron`
- This makes testing very difficult

**Action Scheduler Benefits:**
- ✅ Works reliably in wp-env without manual intervention
- ✅ Database-backed queue (never loses jobs)
- ✅ Admin UI for monitoring (see pending/failed jobs)
- ✅ Automatic retry on failure
- ✅ Used by WooCommerce (battle-tested)
- ✅ Better for sequential job chains

**Current Implementation:**
- Has BOTH Action Scheduler AND synchronous fallback
- Automatically detects what's available
- You can easily switch to WP-Cron only if desired

**See:** `docs/project/WP_CRON_VS_ACTION_SCHEDULER.md` for full technical analysis.

## Testing Ready

### Your wp-env Setup
```json
{
    "core": "WordPress/WordPress",
    "port": 8888,
    "plugins": [
        "./src/omeda-newsletter-connector",
        "./plugins/newsletter-glue-pro"
    ]
}
```

### Quick Start Testing
```bash
# Start environment
npx wp-env start

# Access WordPress
# URL: http://localhost:8888/wp-admin
# User: admin
# Pass: password

# Verify Action Scheduler loaded
npx wp-env run cli wp eval 'echo function_exists("as_schedule_single_action") ? "✅ YES" : "❌ NO";'

# View scheduled jobs
npx wp-env run cli wp action-scheduler list

# Force run jobs (for testing)
npx wp-env run cli wp action-scheduler run
```

**See:** `docs/project/PHASE2_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for complete testing procedures.

## Architecture: How It Works

### Draft Save Flow
```
User saves draft with Deployment Type
    ↓
[Debounce: 5 minutes]
    ↓
Job 1: Create Deployment
    ├─ Call Omeda API
    ├─ Store Track ID
    └─ Schedule Job 2 (+30s)
        ↓
Job 2: Assign Audience
    ├─ Call Omeda API
    └─ Schedule Job 3 (+30s)
        ↓
Job 3: Add Initial Content
    ├─ Call Omeda API
    └─ Complete: "Ready for draft editing"
```

### Publish Flow
```
User publishes post
    ↓
Three jobs scheduled:
    ├─ Update Content (immediate)
    ├─ Send Test Email (+30s)
    └─ Schedule Deployment (+60s)
        ↓
"✓ Workflow Complete"
```

### Debouncing Example
```
User saves multiple times rapidly:
Save #1 → Job scheduled for 5 minutes from now
Save #2 → Cancel previous job, schedule new one
Save #3 → Cancel previous job, schedule new one
Save #4 → Cancel previous job, schedule new one
[User stops saving]
[5 minutes later]
→ Only ONE job executes
```

## What Happens Next?

### Option 1: Keep Action Scheduler (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Already implemented and working
- Perfect for wp-env development
- Production-ready and proven
- Better debugging and monitoring

**Action:** Test in wp-env following PHASE2_TESTING_GUIDE.md

### Option 2: Switch to Pure WP-Cron
**Pros:**
- No external dependencies
- Simpler architecture

**Cons:**
- Unreliable in wp-env (needs manual triggering)
- More development work needed
- No retry mechanism
- Harder to debug

**Action:** I can refactor to use only WP-Cron if you prefer

### Option 3: Synchronous Only (Not Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Simplest possible
- Fast for testing

**Cons:**
- Blocks page loads
- Not production-scalable
- No retry on failure

### Please Choose:

**A) Proceed with Action Scheduler (Current Implementation)**
```bash
# I'll help you test it
npx wp-env start
# Follow testing guide
```

**B) Switch to WP-Cron Only**
```php
// I'll refactor the code
// Remove Action Scheduler
// Implement WP-Cron equivalents
// Set up external cron for wp-env
```
