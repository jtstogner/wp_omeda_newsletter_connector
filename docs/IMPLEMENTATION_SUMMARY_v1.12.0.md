# Implementation Summary - Enhanced Error Logging

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Version:** 1.12.0  
**Implemented By:** AI Assistant

## Problem Statement
You were experiencing an HTTP 400 error when adding content to Omeda deployments, but the workflow logs weren't showing the full API request and response details needed to debug the issue. The error message was:
```
Content assignment failed: Omeda API Error (HTTP 400)
```

However, you couldn't see:
- What data was actually being sent to Omeda
- What error response Omeda was returning
- The specific error messages from the API

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `log_error_details()` Method
**File:** `includes/class-omeda-workflow-manager.php`

Added a new logging method that **always** logs error context data regardless of the configured logging level:

```php
/**
 * Log error details - ALWAYS logs regardless of logging level.
 * Used for critical error context like API request/response data.
 */
public function log_error_details($post_id, $message, $context = null, $step = null) {
    // Always log error details as RAW level, regardless of current logging setting
    $this->add_to_workflow_log($post_id, $message, 'RAW', $context, $step);
}
```

**Why:** The existing `log_raw()` method only logged when logging level was set to 'raw'. This new method ensures error details are always captured.

### 2. Updated Error Handling in `handle_add_content()`
**File:** `includes/class-omeda-async-jobs.php`

Modified the catch block to use the new logging method:

```php
// ALWAYS log full error details for debugging (regardless of logging level)
// This uses log_error_details which doesn't require 'raw' logging level
$error_details = [
    'url' => $error_data['url'] ?? 'N/A',
    'method' => $error_data['method'] ?? 'N/A',
    'http_code' => $error_data['http_code'] ?? 'N/A',
    'request_payload' => $error_data['payload'] ?? 'N/A',
    'response_body' => $error_data['response_body'] ?? 'N/A'
];
$this->workflow_manager->log_error_details($post_id, 'API Request/Response Details', $error_details, $step_name);
```

**What it captures:**
- **url**: The full Omeda API endpoint being called
- **method**: HTTP method (POST, GET, etc.)
- **http_code**: HTTP status code (400, 401, 500, etc.)
- **request_payload**: Complete XML/JSON sent to Omeda (including all fields and content)
- **response_body**: Full response from Omeda (including error messages)

### 3. Updated Plugin Version
**File:** `omeda-wp-integration.php`

- Updated version from 1.11.0 to 1.12.0
- Follows semantic versioning for minor enhancements

## How It Works

### Before (v1.11.0)
```
[ERROR] Content assignment failed: Omeda API Error (HTTP 400)
Context: —
```

### After (v1.12.0)
```
[ERROR] Content assignment failed: Omeda API Error (HTTP 400)
Context: —

[RAW] API Request/Response Details
Context: View Details ▼
    Array
    (
        [url] => https://ows.omeda.com/webservices/rest/brand/BRAND/omail/deployment/content/*
        [method] => POST
        [http_code] => 400
        [request_payload] => <?xml version="1.0"?>
                            <Deployment>
                              <TrackId>MTGMCD251029012</TrackId>
                              <UserId>12345</UserId>
                              ...full XML content here...
                            </Deployment>
        [response_body] => Array
            (
                [Errors] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => Array
                            (
                                [Error] => Specific error message explaining the problem
                            )
                    )
            )
    )
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Trigger the workflow** by saving a newsletter
2. **Navigate to:** Omeda → Workflow Logs → View Details for your newsletter
3. **Look for the error entry** (marked with red ERROR badge)
4. **Expand the RAW context** for "API Request/Response Details"
5. **Review the full details** including what was sent and what Omeda returned

## Expected Benefits

1. **Immediate Error Visibility**: No need to change logging levels or check multiple log sources
2. **Complete Context**: See both request and response in one place
3. **Faster Debugging**: Identify the exact issue (missing fields, invalid format, etc.)
4. **Better Support**: Can easily share error details when reporting issues

## Next Debugging Steps

With the enhanced logging in place, you can now:

1. **Identify Missing Fields**: Check if required Omeda fields are present in the request
2. **Spot Format Issues**: See if XML structure matches Omeda's expectations
3. **Find Content Problems**: Detect if content has invalid characters or encoding issues
4. **Verify Configuration**: Ensure deployment type settings are correct
