# Version 1.6.0 Release Summary

## What Was Done

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive **Workflow Logs Page** for the Omeda WordPress Integration plugin and addressed your issue with the admin menu access.

## Problem Solved

**Your Issue:** "ok, i dont have the link to the log in the admin menu. and when trying to access directly i get a message stating that i'm not allowed to access the page"

**Root Cause:** The workflow logs functionality existed in the Workflow Manager class, but there was no admin menu item or page to view these logs. You had to access the database or debug.log directly.

**Solution:** Created a complete admin interface for viewing workflow logs with proper menu integration and permission handling.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Admin Menu Item
Added "Workflow Logs" submenu under "Omeda Integration":
- **Location:** Omeda Integration → Workflow Logs
- **Position:** Between Settings and Background Jobs
- **Access:** Administrators only (manage_options capability)

### 2. New Admin Page
Complete logs viewing interface with:
- **Main List View:**
  - Shows all posts with workflow logs
  - Displays Post ID, Title, Type, Status, Last Modified
  - Pagination (20 posts per page)
  - "View Logs" and "Edit Post" buttons

- **Detail View:**
  - Shows individual post workflow information
  - Lists all log entries with timestamps
  - Color-coded by severity (ERROR=red, WARN=yellow, INFO=green)
  - Displays full context data
  - Quick navigation back to list

### 3. Version Update
Bumped plugin version from 1.5.0 to 1.6.0 (minor release for new feature)

### 4. Files Synced
Copied all changes from `src/` to `wp-content/plugins/` so WordPress sees the updates

## How to Access

### Via Menu (Recommended)
```
1. Log in to wp-admin (admin/password)
2. Click "Omeda Integration" in left sidebar
3. Click "Workflow Logs" submenu item
```

### Direct URL
```
http://localhost:8889/wp-admin/admin.php?page=omeda-workflow-logs

## What You'll See

- Create a test post with deployment type to generate logs
