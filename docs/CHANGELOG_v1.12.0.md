## Changes

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Enhanced Error Logging**: Fixed issue where API request/response details were not visible in workflow logs during errors
  - Added `log_error_details()` method to workflow manager that always logs error context regardless of logging level
  - Updated `handle_add_content()` error handler to use new logging method
  - Error details now always include:
    - Request URL and method
    - HTTP status code
    - Request payload (what was sent to Omeda)
    - Response body (what Omeda returned)
    - Individual error messages from Omeda API

### üìù Logging Improvements
- API error responses are now fully captured and displayed in workflow logs
- Raw request/response data is logged when errors occur, making debugging easier
- Error context is preserved even when logging level is set to "basic" or "advanced"

- Version now increments following semantic versioning:
